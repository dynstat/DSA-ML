# Testcase Example:  '[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]'
#
# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines
# drawn such that the two endpoints of the i^th line are (i, 0) and (i,
# height[i]).
# 
# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the
# container contains the most water.
# 
# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
# 
# Notice that you may not slant the container.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array
# [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the
# container can contain is 49.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == height.length
# 2 <= n <= 10^5
# 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4
# 
# 
#

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # create two pointers left and right
        # shift the left pointer if it is smaller than right, else 
        # shift the right pointer.
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right: # TODO
            area = 0
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                area = height[left] * (right - left)
                left += 1
            else:
                area = height[right] * (right - left)
                right -= 1

            max_area = max(max_area, area)
        return max_area
